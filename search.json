    "text": "Basic computing terminology\n\nResources and computer components\n\nJob\n\nSome unit of work or collection of tasks that needs to be performed by a computing system. In typical usage this is not well defined, and the scope of what a job is can vary wildly. I typically use job to refer to some logically connected group of tasks that I want the computer to perform.\n\nTask\n\nA small unit of work, usually a specific operation performed by the computer. Often a part of a larger job.\n\nCPU (central processing unit)\n\nThe core computational unit of a PC or node. This is the hardware component that performs computations. AKA: Processor.\n\nMemory / RAM\n\nSite of temporary information storage for holding data while computations are performed on the data. Important note: this is distinct from data storage.\n\nData storage / disk space\n\nPermanent or long term storage of data.\n\n\n\n\nAn imperfect analogy\nThroughout this page, we will use an analogy to help understand computing. The goal here is to develop a mental model of computing and the interplay of computing components and resources that enables users to more effectively and efficiently utilize the resources they have access to.\nThink about computing as being like a bakery. At this bakery, the overall goal is to prepare all of the menu items and operate the store front.\nThere are many jobs at this bakery: baking croissants, preparing pastry creams and jams, stocking the pastry cases, and washing dishes among many others. Each job is composed of specific tasks: kneading bread dough and placing doughnuts in a pastry case are just a couple of examples. These similarities follow pretty naturally from how we use the terms in computing.\nThese jobs and tasks obviously aren’t going to perform themselves. Someone must do these tasks, and they have to have physical resources to perform their tasks. We can think of the bakers as being like CPUs. The bakers are who physically perform the tasks of kneading and placing according to recipes and standard operating procedures, much like the CPU performs computations based on sets of instructions called programs. In this analogy the raw ingredients, goods in progress like dough, and kitchen equipment such as mixers represent memory. The ingredients and equipment are used temporarily by the bakers, often to transform one thing into another such as shaping a ball of dough into a loaf or using a dish brush to wash a plate. This is much like the role memory plays in computing, where it temporarily holds data while the CPU performs computations on the data. Finally, there are many parts of a bakery that act like data storage. This includes the pastry case that holds the finished baked goods in the store front, the shelves in the kitchen that hold equipment, and even the recipe book."
