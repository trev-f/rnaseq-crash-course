# Trim Reads

## Learning objectives

- Trim raw reads with fastp
- Generate trimmed reads QC reports with FastQC
- Produce a composite trimmed reads QC report with MultiQC

## Purpose

Even successful and high quality sequencing runs produce some problematic reads or portions of reads.
The most common issues we run into include low quality base calls and the presence of adapters at the ends of reads.
These problematic reads can cause issues in data quality in downstream steps, so we use read trimming to remove them.

After read trimming, we run FastQC on the trimmed reads to make sure the trimming mitigated any issues observed at the raw reads QC step.
