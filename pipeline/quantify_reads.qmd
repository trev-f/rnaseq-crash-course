# Quantify reads within genes

## Objectives

- Generate table of counts within genes

## Purpose

Counting reads transforms the sequencing data that we have been processing into quantities that we can readily analyze.

## Overview of counting workflow

    ref_annotations[(Reference\nAnnotations)]
    mappings[(Mappings)]
    counts_table[(Counts\ntable)]
    counts_summary[(Counts\nsummary)]
    count_reads{featureCounts}

    mappings --- count_reads
    ref_annotations --- count_reads
    count_reads --> counts_table
```
