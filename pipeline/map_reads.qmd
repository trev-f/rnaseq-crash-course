# Map Reads

## Learning objectives

- Download reference genome and annotations
- Map reads to reference genome with STAR
- Generate index for BAM files
- Generate QC report for mapped reads

## Purpose

Mapping high-quality reads to a reference is a fundamental step in a typical RNA-seq analysis.

This mapping step assigns a read to the genomic locus that it is (likely) derived from.
We can use this mapping information to generate a variety of data for downstream analysis such as determining the expression levels of genes, identifying novel splice sites, and identifying genomic variants[^1].

After read trimming, we run FastQC on the trimmed reads to make sure the trimming mitigated any issues observed at the raw reads QC step.

[^1]: The types of analyses we can perform are determined by factors such as availability of genomic resources, library construction, sequencing depth, etc.
