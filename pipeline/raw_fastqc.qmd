# Raw Reads FastQC

## Learning objectives

- Generate raw reads QC reports with FastQC
- Produce a compositve raw reads QC report with MultiQC

## Purpose

Raw reads QC should be performed to ensure that the quality of reads that came off of the sequencing platform is acceptable.
FastQC is a straightforward command line tool for generating QC reports for reads in fastq format.

A few of the metrics we're most interested in include:

- Total number of reads and bases.
- Average quality along reads.
- Overrepresented sequences.
- Adapter contamination.
